# Project Sandcastle
Git tracked listing of data sources and descriptions designed to facilitate financial data retrieval by documenting the data sets available through the Fintech Sandbox to include provider information, ingest scripts, and example data. See http://www.fintechsandbox.org for more information. 

## Contribution Guidelines 
Contributions should detail any/some/all of the following items:
  - Which data sets you're currently using and how you're accessing them
  - How you're using said data sets
  - General experience with the data set and tips to facilitate the process for new startups
  - Addition of example data sets or ingest scripts that you found helpful
  - Some folks have had success purely working from the provider's documentation. If there was any documentation you found particularly helpful, either link it, or add it to the repo. 
  
## Contact
Feel free to post any issues/comments/requests as issues in this repository (please tag the relevant parties), on the Fintech Sandbox slack channel, or to ping any of the involved companies at their sandbox@\<company\> email address.
