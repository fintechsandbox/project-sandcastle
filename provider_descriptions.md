## Alexandria

Alexandria uses the content and context of news stories to analyze the information in real time and provide a sentiment analysis. Using probabilistic algorithms developed from a concept-based, non-linear statistical methodology of testing finance professionals, Alexandria has the ability to model complex dependencies between various words of semantic information, which helps it better identify sentiment than standard rules-based approaches. Sentiment data over a certain period is aggregated into a log net sentiment metric, which can then be compared with other companies in the market.

**Example Usage**
- Market sentiment analysis

## Factset

Factset contains similar data to Bloomberg, but makes it more easily available (and cheaper) by delivering it as CSV through FTP. 

** Example Usage**
- pricing and fundamental data 

## SIX Financial

SIX Financial offers reference data on corporate actions and price information from a compilation of over 1,500 sources globally. Pricing and market information is drawn in real-time, along with data on fixed income and dividends. For fixed income and derivative securities that are not quoted, SIX uses a internal pricing system to price securities four times per day. 

**Example Usage**
- Fixed income and corporate actions
- Pricing of non-quoted securities
- Index pricing

## Thompson Reuters

Thompson Reuters provides access to thousands of fundamental data points from the three main financial statements and beyond.
